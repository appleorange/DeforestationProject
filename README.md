# Forest Change Monitoring Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to **protect forests** by monitoring forest change using **remote sensing data** and **machine learning techniques**. The primary goal is to combat illegal logging and deforestation by providing automated alerts based on satellite imagery analysis.

Currently, forests cover **one-third of the planet**, but deforestation is rapidly reducing this coverage. Illegal logging is a significant threat to forest ecosystems. This project uses satellite data and advanced image processing to detect forest loss and pinpoint areas that need attention.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing Satellite Images
- Collected raw satellite images from **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.
- Preprocessed the images by calculating the **Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)**, which measures vegetation density.
- Annotated images with **location coordinates** and relevant information.
- Stacked the images in chronological order for time-series analysis.

### 2. Forest Change Detection
- Developed a detector that uses **EVI/NDVI** to identify changes in vegetation.
    - The detector compares the EVI of two images taken at different times to classify and quantify forest loss or gain.
- Built a **Protected Areas Detector** that tracks forest changes specifically in areas where illegal logging frequently occurs, using data from the **World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)**.

### 3. Case Study: Amazon Rainforest
The tool was applied to the **Brazilian Amazon rainforest**, an area frequently impacted by illegal logging. The workflow included:
- Running simulations based on previously reported illegal logging incidents to verify the toolâ€™s accuracy.
- The tool successfully identified deforestation and provided specific location information.
- Manual verification was performed using **Copernicus satellite aero images**.

## Results
The tool demonstrates that combining remote sensing and machine learning can automate deforestation detection **at scale**. By generating actionable alerts, the software can support local law enforcement efforts in **monitoring and addressing illegal logging activities** more effectively.

## Conclusion
This project shows that leveraging **multiple technologies** can improve the detection and prevention of deforestation. The signals generated by this tool could provide a valuable resource for **forest conservation efforts** and help protect vital ecosystems.

## Future Work
- Expand the project to include other regions affected by illegal logging.
- Improve the accuracy of forest loss detection using more advanced machine learning models.
- Collaborate with local authorities to deploy this tool for real-time deforestation monitoring.
